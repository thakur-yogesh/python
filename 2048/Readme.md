# 2048 Game with Tkinter

This repository contains Python code for a 2048 game implemented using the Tkinter library. The 2048 game is a popular single-player sliding tile puzzle game in which the player combines numbered tiles to reach the 2048 tile.

## Installation

To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your system. The code is compatible with Python 3.x.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install tkinter library using  `pip install tkinter` that is the only dependency.
3. Then run the command `python main.py` to start the game


The game window will open, and you can start playing the 2048 game using the arrow keys.

## How to Play

1. When the game window opens, you will see a 4x4 grid with 1 tile already placed randomly.
2. Use the keys (W for Up,S for Down, A for Left,D for Right) to move the tiles in the desired direction.
3. Tiles with the same number will merge when they collide.
4. After each move, a new tile with either the number 2 or 4 will appear in an empty spot on the board.
5. The objective of the game is to reach the 2048 tile by merging tiles.
6. If the board fills up and there are no valid moves left, the game is over.
   
## Packaged Application
1. This is the packaged version of the game, where one can directly run the game by two left clicks of the mouse. 
2. Just press enter when the console comes up :)
